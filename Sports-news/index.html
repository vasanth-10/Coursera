                     <p>West Indies batsman Brian Lara recorded the highest-ever Test score by slamming an unbeaten 400 against England at St John's in Antigua. On the third day of the fourth and final Test of England's tour of the West Indies in 2004, Lara broke Matthew Hayden's record of the highest Test score of 380, which the Australian opener had scored against Zimbabwe less than a year earlier in Perth. The match ended in a draw, but it was a knock that has been etched in cricketing history<p>
